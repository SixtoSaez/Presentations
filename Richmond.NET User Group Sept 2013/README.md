Richmond.NET User Group Sept 2013 - Debugging Memory Leaks in javascript
=============

These are the demo code and slides for presentations. I misspelled Douglas Crockford's name in the slides and it's now corrected.

Also, the Windows Store HTML & javascript project will only open on a Windows 8.x machine. It cannot be opened in Visual Studio 2012 on a WIndows 7 machine. Enjoy!
