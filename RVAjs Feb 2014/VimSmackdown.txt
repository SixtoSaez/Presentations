Why Vim
    
    Daniel Miessler believes people should use vim for the following three reasons:
    It's ubiquitous. You don't have to worry about learning a new editor on various boxes.
    It's scalable. You can use it just to edit config files or it can become your entire writing platform.
    It's powerful. Because it works like a language vim takes you from frustrated to demigod very quickly.

Vim Basics

    Modes:
        insert - what every other editor normally works in
        normal - (grey matter intensive) keyboard shortcuts to the Vim editor commands
        visual - a subset of normal mode specifically used to select text
        Ex     - another command mode to pass the Ex editor commands such as :q!

Code editing:

    // Simple editing (commands j, k, h, l, x, u, <C-r>, r, R, i, y, zA)
    var myModule = myModule || {};
    myModule.myValue = 123;
    myModule.someAction = function (someDefault) {
        var self = this, myLocalNumber = 0;
        self.myValue = self.myValue || someDefault;
    }
